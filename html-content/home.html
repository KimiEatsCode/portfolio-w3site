<h3 class="intro">I view my work experience as a 360 degree journey. Having earned my Bachelors and Masters in Media studies, as a media professional I easily evolved my media skills to keep up with the changing tech and social landscape of the time. Today, I have the unique advantage to bring all my mastered skills together - print and layout design, web dev and web design, digital marketing, graphic design and user experience design - to make ideas come alive using a combination of generative AI tools and industry professional methods.</h3>
